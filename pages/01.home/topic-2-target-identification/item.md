A brief video explaining how synthetic chemistry can help find the biological target(s) of a lead compound. These concepts will be illustrated by a case study during lectures.

##### Case Study - pladienolides
These concepts will be illustrated by a case study during lectures. I have uploaded the PDF for this case study on Learning@Griffith. Please read through this paper carefully before coming to lecture, having thought about the concepts I've outlined in this video. When you read this paper, think about these questions:

1. What tags did the scientists use?
2. Why did they use these tags?
3. What information did this give them?
