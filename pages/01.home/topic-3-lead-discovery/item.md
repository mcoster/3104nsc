Please watch the videos linked in this post. They summarise the use of Combinatorial Chemistry (CombiChem) and Parallel Synthesis techniques in Drug Discovery.

===


The most important parts of this video are between 11:47 and 17:18, although it is all relevant to this course. While you watch it, think about the following:
_**What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of CombiChem vs. Parallel Synthesis**_

In what situations do you think you could use each of these techniques?  

This video may look quite old-fashioned! Nevertheless, it gives some good insights into the use of CombiChem in industry.   
_**What are some 'barriers to entry' in the use of CombiChem techniques?**_

Since its early applications to drug discovery, CombiChem techniques have been applied to many other areas of chemistry research - _can you propose any areas that might benefit from this approach?_
